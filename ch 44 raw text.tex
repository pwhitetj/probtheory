\item %finan 44.10 ‡
A company offers a basic life insurance policy to its employees, as well as a
supplemental life insurance policy. To purchase the supplemental policy, an
employee must first purchase the basic policy.
Let $X$ denote the proportion of employees who purchase the basic policy, and
Y the proportion of employees who purchase the supplemental policy. Let
X and $Y$ have the joint density function$ f_{XY}(x,y) = 2(x + y)$ on the region
where the density is positive.
Given that 10\% of the employees buy the basic policy, what is the probability
that fewer than 5\% buy the supplemental policy?



\item %finan 44.11 ‡
An auto insurance policy will pay for damage to both the policyholder’s car
and the other driver’s car in the event that the policyholder is responsible
for an accident. The size of the payment for damage to the policyholder’s
car, X, has a marginal density function of 1 for $0 < X < 1$. Given $X = x$, the
size of the payment for damage to the other driver’s car, Y, has conditional
density of 1 for $X < y < X + 1$.

If the policyholder is responsible for an accident, what is the probability that
the payment for damage to the other driver’s car will be greater than 0.5?



\item %finan 44.17 ‡
A machine has two components and fails when both components fail. The
number of years from now until the first component fails, $X$, and the number
of years from now until the machine fails, $Y$, are random variables with joint
density function
$$f_{XY} = \dfrac{1}{18}e^{-(x+y)/6} \qquad 0<x<y$$

As a block of concrete is put under increasing pressure, engineers measure the
pressure $X$ at which the first fracture appears and the pressure $Y$ at which
the second fracture appears. $X$ and $Y$ are measured in tons per square inch
and have joint density function

$$f_{XY}=24x(1-y) \qquad 0<x<y<1$$

appears, given that the first fracture appears at $1/3$ ton per square inch.


\item %finan 44.20
Let $X$ and $Y$ be two continuous random variables with joint density function
$f_{XY}(x,y)$.

\item %finan 44.21 ‡
The elapsed time, T, between the occurrence and the reporting of an accident
has probability density function
$$f_T(t) = \dfrac{8t-t^2}{72} \qquad 0<t<6$$

Given that $T = t$, the elapsed time between the reporting of the accident
and payment by the insurer is uniformly distributed on $[2 + t, 10]$.
Calculate the probability that the elapsed time between the occurrence of
the accident and payment by the insurer is less than 4.
